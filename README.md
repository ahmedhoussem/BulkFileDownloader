# BulkFileDownloader
A quick and dirty .NET WPF app i've made to download files in bulk

This is a quick utility i've made to download image in bulk from a text file containing URLs for tensorflow model training , nothing fancy ...

Feel free to download it and use it how ever you want , to use it all you have to do is :

* Click the "Select File" button and select the text file containing the URLs separated by backspaces 
ex : 
http://url.to/images1.jpg
http://url.to/images2.jpg
http://url.to/images3.jpg


* Click the "Select Folder" button to select the folder where you want your files to be downloaded :
* Click the "Download" button and wait for the label to say "Completed"
